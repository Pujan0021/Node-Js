The old lighthouse keeper, Elias Thorne, had lived by the sea his entire life. The rhythmic crash of the waves was the soundtrack to his existence, the salty air the only perfume he ever knew. His face was a map of wrinkles, each line etched by sun, wind, and countless silent nights watching over the rocky coast. He had seen storms that could swallow ships whole and calms so profound the ocean became a mirror to the endless sky.
One particularly stormy night, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the very foundations of the sturdy stone lighthouse. The beacon, a powerful eye of light, swept its beam across the churning blackness, a steadfast sentinel in the chaos. A young sailor, barely more than a boy, washed ashore, clinging to a piece of wreckage. Elias, guided by the light of his lantern, found the shivering youth on the sand. He brought the boy inside, wrapped him in a coarse blanket, and stoked the fire in the hearth.
The boy, whose name was Finn, spoke of a ghost ship, a vessel shrouded in an unnatural mist that had appeared out of nowhere and caused their own ship to founder. Elias listened patiently, his eyes distant. He knew the legends of the coast, tales of a cursed galleon that sailed only during the fiercest gales, forever seeking vengeance for a long-forgotten betrayal. Most dismissed them as sailors' myths, but Elias had lived here long enough to know that the sea held secrets deeper and stranger than any man could fully comprehend.
